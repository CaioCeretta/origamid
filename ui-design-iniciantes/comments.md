## Design Introduction

### What is Design?

There isn't a consensus about what is design, there are many definitions and the one used in this course is the one that
makes most sense for the instructor, and which has the most sense applied mainly for the web, that is, `Design is Project`

When we talk about project, we are talking about something that needs to be planned, a plan that is going to be executed.

This plan involves research, that is an essential part for the design, for us to research the competitor, what already
exists in the market. Let's use a website for a restaurant as an example, we'll go by every restaurant site to see the
context, who will utilize this site, for what they'll utilize this site, why do they want a restaurant website, to look for
an address? a telephone?

So we need to understand what are the limits of this project, we need to undertand its goals, if it's only to show the phone
number and the address of the store, or if it'll be able to make orders online, this would change completely how the planning
would be, so we need to understand the limits and make researchs, that is the initial planning. 

The next step after this is the execution, that is what most people think that is the only part of a design. That is creating
the artifact we will deliver.

### Execution 

- Prototyping
- Final delivery

And in this execution steps, there's also another essential part, which is the testing, for us to check if our prototype
or no, so this step will be made by possible users of our website, and verify if a button works, if people are finding easily
where is the purchase part of the site, finding the address, and so on. And if this hasn't worked during the tests, we go back
to the execution, and recreate what we just did, to try another solution that works.

### Plan

Here we'll use three examples: Github, Youtube and Dropbox

In those three websites, we can see similarities on the menu, all of them utilize their brand on the navbar and on the left
side, and we can see that most of the sites that exist in the whole internet, has the brand on the left.

Another similarity that we can see, is that both youtube and github, has a search bar on the navbar, but on dropbox, we
don't see any search field. And we need to think, "Why dropbox didn't place a search box on the navbar like the others?"

This happened because on their planning step, they decided that wasn't necessary for the user, to search anything on the
site. Because on the landing page, we just want the user to subscribe to the platform, there is no internal dropbox content
that people need to search.

Differently from youtube, when someone enters the website, they want to search for a specific video/subject, the same for
github, the first thing someone wants to do, is to search a code repository
